			"paragraph-second": "The SK proposes a reconfiguration of supersystems (microparticles, macroscopic, and biological) that overlap and interconnect from the supercomplexity of the universe and life. It also postulates a methodology for describing, predicting, and intervening by building and linking maps and algorithms as tools to discover, understand, and manipulate the dynamics and structures of complex systems.",

		"section-first": {
			"paragraph-first": "Many thinkers agree that the 21st century is the “century of complexity.” However, the concept of “complexity” is polysemous, multivocal, multidimensional, and multifaceted. There is some consensus on the etymology of “complex” as “that which is united and intertwined.” A network of systems embedded and connected to each other without gaps.",
			"paragraph-second": "It was in the mid-20th century that Complexity Theories began to emerge as an alternative to monocausal, simplified, and deterministic explanations, anchored in the guiding principles of mechanism, reductionism, and empiricism that predominated in the science of that time.",
			"paragraph-third": "Complex Thought and Complexity Sciences emerged and consolidated as the two most representative approaches. These approaches are sometimes perceived as opposed to each other, with significant tensions between them, arising from differences in their methodologies, assumptions, and areas of emphasis."
		},
		"section-second": {
			"title": "Our Proposal: Supercomplex Knowledge (SK)",
			"paragraph-first": "The goal of our research and work is to develop a unifying and surpassing proposal to address the vast mosaic that has made Complexity Theories an edifice with many disconnected theories, difficult to access and rarely applied to social and human issues. ",
			"paragraph-first-strong": "Supercomplex Knowledge (SK) draws from the rich roots of Complex Thought and Complexity Sciences, as well as from the preexisting knowledge upon which the initial proposals were based, and from current knowledge that strengthens and energizes new and superior perspectives."
		},
		"object": {
				"title": "Object of Study",
				"content": "Supercomplex Knowledge focuses on complex systems, proposing a new foundational gnoseology (complex constructivism) and a reconfiguration of the components of complex systems (energy flows, structural morphologies, and temporal connectivity in interaction). This articulates a comprehensive taxonomy of macrosystems—microparticles, macroscopic, and biological—with their respective overlaps, generating truly incredible and often overlooked behaviors. It also suggests a reinterpretation of space and time from a supercomplexity perspective; a methodology of description that integrates mathematical, computational, and conceptual elements. The circularity between theory and action is emphasized, with a focus on the construction of maps and algorithms using proprietary software as a tool for intervention and improvement of institutions and planetary issues."
			},
			"principles": {
				"title": "Core Principles of the Supercomplex Knowledge Proposal",
				"bullets": {
					"1": "A redefinition of complex systems as an object of study. It cannot be ignored that Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Deep Learning have revolutionized and deepened the modeling and understanding of complex systems. Likewise, the development of advanced instruments such as sensors and specialized software is increasingly facilitating this task.",
					"2": "A novel proposal on the components of complex systems: energy flows, structural morphologies, and temporal connectivity in interaction.",
					"3": "A selection of events, such as cosmic inflation, the appearance of cosmic objects, and the emergence of life, as generators of different levels of complexity and incredible complex behaviors.",
					"4": "A proposed taxonomy of macrosystems (microparticles, macroscopic, and biological), complex systems and subsystems derived from them, and a model of dynamic triple overlapping among these macrosystems, demonstrating that there is no arrow of complexity.",
					"5": "A methodology of description, prediction, and intervention that builds and links maps and algorithms as tools to discover, understand, and manipulate the dynamics and structures of complex systems, presenting an intervention and development program along with associated software to monitor and potentially improve concrete complex systems with applications to all major social and planetary issues."

			"title": "Who We Are",
			"paragraph-first": "We are a community dedicated to researching and developing the Supercomplex Knowledge paradigm as a powerful tool to understand and transform the multidimensional reality that surrounds us.",
			"paragraph-second": "Our Assistance and Development Program is designed to address the growth and enhancement needs of government administrations, businesses, and institutions interested in improving the fulfillment of their functions and objectives. The implementation possibilities of the Program are numerous, such as: natural resource protection systems; discovery of new chemical elements and their combinations; astronomical and climatological development; design of alternative energy sources; addressing social issues such as the development of health, education, and justice systems; strategies to combat malnutrition, diseases, corruption, or drug trafficking; enhancement of production and sales systems in industrial and commercial institutions.",
			"paragraph-third": "This proposal arises after years of work and study, driven by the desire to offer an integrative and surpassing theory of Complex Thought, Complexity Sciences, and other related approaches, allowing not only theoretical development but also practical and methodological application."

Supercomplex Knowledge represents the construction of a paradigm that seeks to integrate and surpass Complex Thought and Complexity Sciences, beginning with the redefinition of its object of study, proposing a new foundational gnoseology (complex constructivism) and a reconfiguration of the components of complex systems (energy flows, structural morphologies, and temporal connectivity in interaction). This includes a complete taxonomy of macrosystems—microparticles, macroscopic, and biological—with their respective overlaps, generating truly incredible and often overlooked behaviors. It also proposes a reinterpretation of space and time from a supercomplex perspective; a methodology of description that integrates mathematical, computational, and conceptual elements. Additionally, it suggests a revision of current anthropological categories, proposing the emergence of “Homo Supercomplexus” in this new era of the Anthropocene and Technocene."
